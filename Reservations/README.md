# vRealize Automation - Reservation Service

A reservation is a pool of resources for provisioning, consisting of several different types of resources. For example, a virtual reservation allocates a share of the memory, CPU and storage resources on a particular compute resource for a business group to use. You can use the Reservation Service to manage reservations.

## Available Use Cases

### Reservation

 * CRUD on storage reservation policy

NOTE: A fabric administrator should be able to manage rservation and reservation policies.
